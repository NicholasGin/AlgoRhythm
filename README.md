# **ALGORHYTHM**

## Project Description <br>

### **What does the application do?** <br>
>Our web application is an educational game that helps students understand the merge sort algorithm.

### **What technologies did we use?** <br>
> When creating AlgoRhythm, we used the following technologies: React.js, Node.js, Firebase and GCP cloud.

### **What are the challenges we faced?**  <br>
> Throughout the development process we came across obstacles that needed to be addressed. Some of these problems were as follows: creating the music sheet in a way that would move as the user progressed through the level, having the application not skip steps, including the life system, etc. One of the bigger areas where we faced a challenge was to demonstrate to the user how the algorithm works from a computer’s perspective. We had originally provided the Merge Sort algorithm in a way that shows how the human mind would compute the algorithm. We had to go back and redo how the application works from a coding/computer perspective and highlight this information to the user. This ultimately impacted every level as this was the basis for the project. 

### **How to install and run the project**
1. Download the source code or clone the repository. <br>
2. In the terminal run ‘npm install’ to install all required dependencies. <br>
3. Next, run ‘npm start’ to run an instance of the game on localhost:3000. <br>

### **How to play**
1. Select an algorithm to learn.
2. Start at Level 1.
3. Follow the instructions to learn the algorithm.
4. For subsequent levels, a piano is displayed below. Click keys with the corresponding number.
5. The number will be displayed in the boxes above the piano. If a mistake is made, press reset to clear the selected numbers.
6. Once the numbers are filled, press submit to check answers.
7. If an error occurs, a life will be lost.
8. If all lives are lost, game over screen will appear with 3 options; reset, quit, or switch algorithms.

### **View analytics**
